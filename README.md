# Increasing-Profits-of-a-Mall-by-using-Clustering
Here in this case,we have dataset of some mall having columns such as : Genre Age Annual Income Spending Score( how often they purchase product in scale of 1-100) Now our aim as a data scientist is to find some patterns in clusters.For example the person who have high spending rate need not to be attracted by some special offer,etc. They will not hesitate to purchase. But our main concern is with those who have less or average spending Score.So what this model does is, it find that cluster(that group of people) having certain property in range and target those people whenever some big offer or discount arrives( by doing SMS,email,etc.) . So in this way, we can attract more and more people to visit mall and make profits for the shopkeepers.
